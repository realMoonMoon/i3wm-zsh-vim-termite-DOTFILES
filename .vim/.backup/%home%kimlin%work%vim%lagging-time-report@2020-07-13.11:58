15 Tried to collect info about license note in RL, hunting for anyone who knew for some time during the day, then by 15 Upgraded bodil-staging to alpha121 as requested. Stressed with the install and forgot to take backup before starting. Asked testers to check if OK before proceeding with bodil-staging2, 10 min later i got a thumbs up and did the upgrade. Shortly after nothing apparently works for the customer. Ola told me to install alpha134 which he found in the developers release channel which made everything worse, confirmed with him first that it was okey to install it... No backups of either installations had been done for the last month alpha134 had problem with database tool so no backup could be done. And no document with all config params existed. With risk of loosing all configs we asked CH to see if they could fix the problems.

    2-3h bodil, Ch was able to fix all issues with db tool so we could save backup. After reading through all the listed issues collected in the testing channel, i checked release notes and noticed they where all listed. Informed testers about it. Customer was then able to access installation. Proceeded to upgrade bodil2 to alpha134, taking backups on both installations before and also new backup after bodil2 upgrade.. Most likley that issues reported on alpha121 could have been fixed according to RL on alpha121.

  ## oprfi-svea - Applied latest anon db in stage again.

9: 5-6h. opr contacted us about not being able to access dev env for oprfi-svea. Turns out that oprfi-svea is used by customer and we should use oprfi-svea2. Total confusion between me, Madeleine and Christian. Rollbacked to several different versions before landing on one taken in beginning of june. Lots of time spent between us sorting out how to avoid this in the future..
